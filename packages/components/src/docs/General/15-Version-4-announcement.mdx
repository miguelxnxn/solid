Dear Community,

Today we're super excited to release the first major rewrite of our documentation in Storybook and Figma to better serve the needs of our direct users: You!

## Backstory
From the very beginning of the project, we tried to align design and development in terms of feature parity. While we could do a lot in this area for our components, we realized that a large part of our work was diverging more and more. There were organizational reasons for that: Design was more focused on providing hand-offs to the Solid developers, while the Solid developers were focused on stabilizing their codebase screenshot tests for more or less every variant of the components we build. Now that the main work of our migration is mostly done, we could stabilize our documentation to improve the experience of designers and developers working with our design system.

## Changes
- **Unified documentation**: Our standards of "alignment between dev and design" have now been extended to our documentation. We try to document every feature the same way to improve consistency and make handoffs even easier. This includes everything from text to visual examples.
- **Docs**: Each component has a single page that contains all the information needed to use it. Our documentation pages now focus on describing all the features a component has, and each feature is shown with a small example.  This applies to both development and design. (Note to all devs: All existing screenshots are still available, but will be moved to a single folder per component).
- **Templates**: Before our rewrite, we distinguished between "samples" and "patterns". This sometimes caused confusion, even within our team. In addition, it was sometimes unclear what a pattern actually was. We decided to combine both concepts into one, and decided to rename it to "Templates", hoping that this would better reflect the understanding of "copy-pastable". They are now listed on the same page level and in addition at every component, that is used in the template.

## Additional Sustainability Benefits
As further benefits of our changes (beyond just side-effects), we would like to highlight several key improvements that elevate our library's sustainability:

- With **Unified documentation**, we have significantly reduced the time spent on alignments, resulting in fewer hours dedicated to this task and less complexity in access management.
- By leveraging **Docs**, we've minimized the number of snapshots required for screenshot testing, reducing server usage and associated costs.
- Thanks to **Templates**, we have streamlined the number of "samples" and "patterns" while clearly identifying reusable components. This accelerates other teams by cutting down on redundant development efforts.
- With all these changes, we've reduced our deployment times. The improved separation of component code, documentation, and infrastructure allows us to make more targeted decisions for each deployment—whether it involves code, documentation, or infrastructure—further optimizing efficiency.

## What's next?
We're still tweaking things here and there. Design has already started adding do's and don'ts, while development is in the process of taking the architecture to a new level and enabling features that are not currently possible.

So: Stay tuned and we're looking forward to your feedback!
Your SDS-Team
